![](images/JDSCA.png)

[JMPX] can encode and modulate DSCA signals.

## Binaries

Precompiled binaries can be downloaded from [Releases].

## Directory structure

The [DSCA](DSCA) directory is where the Qt pro file is for the main application.

## Compiling

Compiling requires the Qt framework which can be obtained from http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ . Qt Creator can be used to compile JDSCA and comes with the Qt framework. At least version 5 of the Qt framework is required.

libopus and libcorrect are also required.
